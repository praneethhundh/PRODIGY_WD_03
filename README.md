This HTML-based Tic Tac Toe game offers a classic gaming experience. Players take turns clicking on cells within a grid to place 'X' or 'O'. The game's interface is clean and responsive, styled with a simple yet effective design using flexbox for layout and CSS for styling. JavaScript handles game logic, including tracking the current player, checking for win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals, and determining a draw scenario. A reset button allows players to start a new game at any time. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and enjoyable game suitable for all ages.
